Cammie's Minecart Tweaks is a mod that makes Minecarts a more viable solution for long-distance transport.

Minecarts can't compete with the speed of an Elytra or Ice Boat, but now, by using Furnace Minecarts, you can get to a higher top speed than is obtainable by Powered Rails.

On top of that, you can now link Minecarts together with Chains, making it a lot easier to form large cargo trains for transporting lots of loot in one go!

Just be careful not to stand on the tracks. We don't want another lawsuit...
